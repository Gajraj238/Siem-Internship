# My Cybersecurity Internship at Srida IT Consulting & Services

Hey there!  
I'm currently enrolled in a high-impact, hands-on **Cybersecurity Internship Program** led by an experienced security leader and proudly sponsored by **Srida IT Consulting and Services Pvt Ltd**. This isn’t your average internship—it’s a deep-dive into the operations of a **real-world Security Operations Center (SOC)**, designed to prepare learners like me to detect, analyze, and respond to live cyber threats using enterprise-grade tools.

---

## My Objective

My goal through this 45-day journey is to become a **job-ready SOC Analyst and SIEM Engineer**. This program doesn't believe in theory-heavy lectures—it's **100% practical** and completely **tool-based**. I'm here to learn by solving actual detection use cases and by building my own threat detection lab from scratch.

---

##  What Makes This Internship Stand Out

-  **Entirely Tool-Driven** – Focused on SIEMs, IDS/IPS, scripting, and detection rules
-  **GitHub as a Portfolio** – All tasks are documented in real time
-  **Challenges Mirror Interview Use Cases**
-  **Simulations of Real Threat Scenarios** – Including ransomware, brute force, phishing, etc.
-  **New Challenges Unlocked Weekly** in a phased progression system
-  **Self-Driven Learning** – With guidance but no spoon-feeding

This isn’t just about learning—it's about **becoming capable**. I'm not just reading about cybersecurity, I’m doing it.

##  Internship Format – 45 Days of Growth

- **Duration:** 6 Weeks (Remote)
- **Structure:** Weekly challenge sets + tool-based tasks
- **Progression:** Phase 2 unlocks upon 80%+ completion of Phase 1
- **Accountability:** Everything tracked publicly on GitHub

---

##  Tools I’m Working With

Here's a snapshot of the powerful tools and platforms I'm gaining hands-on experience with:

- **SIEM Platforms:** ELK Stack, Splunk, Wazuh  
- **Network Analysis:** Wireshark, Zeek  
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Suricata  
- **Detection Engineering:** Sigma Rules  
- **Scripting:** PowerShell, Bash  
- **Others:** Log shippers, alert pipelines, threat intelligence feeds, and log parsers

Each tool helps me dig deeper into security telemetry and build better detection pipelines.

---

##  What I’m Delivering

Each week, I submit a structured report that includes:

-  Challenge write-ups
-  Tool outputs and screenshots
-  Custom rules and scripts
-  Detailed documentation in this GitHub repo

My focus is not just on **completing tasks**, but on **building a credible cybersecurity portfolio**.

---

##  What I’m Actually Learning

This internship is turning theory into execution. Here’s what I’m gaining:

-  Practical detection of 50+ threat types:
  - Brute Force Attacks
  - Lateral Movement
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Ransomware and Phishing
-  Event correlation using logs and alerts
-  Writing and tuning detection rules (e.g., Sigma)
-  Documenting and communicating findings clearly
-  Deploying and operating a mini-SIEM lab

By the end, I aim to **think like an attacker**, **respond like a defender**, and **present like a professional**.

---

##  How Certification Works

Only the most committed learners get certified. To qualify, I must:

-  Complete **at least 80%** of all challenges
-  Maintain a **clean, consistent, and professional** GitHub repository
-  Show **depth of understanding** during the final review

Certification isn’t given for participation—it’s **earned through performance**.

---

##  Final Reflection

> “Real threats don’t come with manuals. Neither does this internship.”

This experience is as close as it gets to being in a live SOC. It’s tough, it’s technical, and it’s transforming how I approach cybersecurity—**not as a subject, but as a mindset**.

Feel free to explore this repository to see my progress. If you’re also exploring a career in cybersecurity, I highly recommend this program.
